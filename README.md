# TourAgency
Training project in ASP.NET MVC

The Tour Agency has a catalog of Tours. For the catalog, implement the ability to select tours:

by type (rest, excursion, shopping);

by price;

by the number of people;

by hotel type;

The Customer registers in the system, chooses the Tour and makes the Order. After ordering, the tour has status 'registered'. An unregistered user is not able to order a tour. The customer has a personal account, which contains brief information about the user, as well as a list of tours and their current status (registered, paid, canceled).

The manager defines the tour as 'Hot'. 'Hot' tours are always displayed at the top of the list.

The manager changes the tour status from 'registered' to 'paid' or 'canceled'. For each ordered tour, a discount is determined with a step that is determined by the manager, but not more than a percentage, which is also determined by the manager.

The system administrator has the same rights as manager, and can also:

add/remove tour, change tour information;

block/unblock user;
